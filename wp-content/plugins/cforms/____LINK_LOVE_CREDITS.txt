
I've been asked a few times how I felt about removing the
link love / credits line underneath the form.

Below you'll find a copy of what I wrote as a response and
how I see it:

****

I've been spending a couple of hundreds of hours overall on cforms,
plus providing free support. Lately, users not only have started
removing the link love from the get-go, but some even had the nerves to
temporarily turn it back on, ask for extensive (*free*) support and
after having received support at no cost, they turned it back off.

Since "link love" is the only form of appreciation I ever asked from
users in return this equates to a slap in the face.

Hence I've decided that if no link love is shown, certain (Ajax related)
functionality will simply not be available and cforms will fall back to
non Ajax form submission. If users disable Ajax, everything works as
usual anyway.

So what are the options for the users/your clients?

(1) Obviously the best: simply leaving the credits/link love in place :-)
(2) Use cforms without Ajax capabilities
(3) Alternative link love in some other place on the site (e.g. credits page)
(4) Or users / commercial clients happen to find something on my Amazon
wish list (or gift card) reflecting the value cforms has to them
(in fact I leave it up the user to determine how much)

(3) & (4) will give you a key that 'unlocks' cforms

Users who paid my Amazon list a visit of course will all have keys.

This is not meant to be a hostile reaction, but a necessary one for my
sanity - if that makes sense.

'Hope for your understanding!
